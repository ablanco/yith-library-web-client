Web client for Yith Library server. Written on top of Pyramid and Ember.js

Server code: https://github.com/lorenzogil/yith-library-server

This web client lets the user access to his passwords and secrets, safely
stored at the Yith Library server. View, editing and deleting are supported.

There is an instance running at http://yithlibrary.com/

Development
-----------

It's recommended to use virtualenv. To know how to create an isolated
enviroment with virtualenv read this http://www.virtualenv.org

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.2
* Node.js 10 or higher

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

After loading your virtualenv (you should be using one!), run this command::

    python setup.py develop

This will install all the dependencies needed. After the installation is
completed, you can execute the server with this command::

    pserve development.ini

And then the web client will be available at http://localhost:6543/

Build the JavaScript bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use Grunt.js to build the minified javascript bundle. So you will need
to install the grunt client in you system. Execute this as root::

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install -g bower

Then you'll need to install the dependencies, run these commands::

    npm install -d
    bower install

Once this has finished, then you can execute the main task that will build
the bundle::

    grunt
